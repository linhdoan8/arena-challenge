# The 2025 ICRA Arena Challenge
As part of the workshop Advances in Social Navigation: Planning, HRI and Beyond, the Arena 2025 challenge aims to benchmark recent state of the art social navigation approaches for navigation in crowded collaborative environments. We utilize our arena platform to host the competition. The **Arena Challenge 2024** invites participants to tackle the complexities of **social navigation** in **crowded, dynamic, and collaborative environments**. The goal is to develop autonomous navigation solutions capable of efficiently maneuvering through environments filled with pedestrians, dynamic obstacles, and realistic social interactions.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview
Participants are required to design and develop navigation algorithms that can handle:
- **Dynamic and Complex Environments**: Navigate through environments populated with moving pedestrians and unpredictable social dynamics.
- **Socially Aware Navigation**: Respect social norms, avoid collisions, and interact safely with dynamic groups.
- **Scalable Difficulty Levels**: Overcome environments that gradually increase in complexity and difficulty.

## 🚀 Challenge Focus
- **Dynamic & Crowded Environments**: Tackle multiple dynamic environments populated with moving pedestrians, obstacles, and social interactions.
- **Social Interaction Awareness**: Navigate while respecting social norms, avoiding collisions, and adapting to unpredictable human behaviors.
- **Collaborative Scenarios**: Address scenarios that require understanding and adapting to group dynamics and collaborative movement within crowds.

## 🛠️ Evaluation Criteria
Algorithms will be evaluated based on:
- **Efficiency**: How quickly and effectively the robot can navigate through the environment.
- **Safety**: Avoidance of collisions with pedestrians and dynamic obstacles.
- **Social Compliance**: Adherence to social norms and smooth navigation in collaborative scenarios.

## 🏆 Prize Money
Top-performing teams will be awarded **prize money** in recognition of their innovative and effective solutions.

## 🛠️ Competition Structure
- A series of **dynamic environments** with varying levels of complexity and difficulty.
- Each environment simulates real-world social dynamics, including:
  - Dense pedestrian traffic
