# The 2025 ICRA Arena Challenge
As part of the workshop Advances in Social Navigation: Planning, HRI and Beyond, the Arena 2025 challenge aims to benchmark recent state of the art social navigation approaches for navigation in crowded collaborative environments. We utilize our arena platform to host the competition. 

## 🚀 Challenge Focus
- **Dynamic & Crowded Environments**: Tackle multiple dynamic environments populated with moving pedestrians, obstacles, and social interactions.
- **Social Interaction Awareness**: Navigate while respecting social norms, avoiding collisions, and adapting to unpredictable human behaviors.
- **Collaborative Scenarios**: Address scenarios that require understanding and adapting to group dynamics and collaborative movement within crowds.

## 🏆 Prize Money
Top-performing teams will be awarded **prize money** in recognition of their innovative and effective solutions.

## 🛠️ Competition Structure
- A series of **dynamic environments** with varying levels of complexity and difficulty.
- Each environment simulates real-world social dynamics, including:
  - Dense pedestrian traffic
  - Variable speeds and unpredictable movements
  - Collaborative human behaviors and group formations

## 👥 Who Should Participate?
- Researchers and professionals in robotics, AI, and autonomous navigation.
- Innovators and developers interested in pushing the boundaries of social navigation.
- Teams dedicated to contributing to safe, efficient, and socially-aware autonomous systems.

## 🌟 Why Participate?
- Benchmark your solutions against industry-leading standards.
- Gain visibility and recognition from experts and industry leaders.
- Contribute to the advancement of social navigation research and real-world applications.
