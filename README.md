## üìä Calculation of Metrics and Points

Performance evaluation will be based on the following metrics:

### 1. Completion Time ( \( T \) )
- The time taken by the robot to navigate from the start to the goal location.

### 2. Collision Penalty ( \( P \) )
- A penalty incurred for each collision with dynamic obstacles or pedestrians, calculated as:

$$
P = N_c \times p
$$

Where:  
- \( N_c \) = Number of collisions  
- \( p \) = Penalty per collision (a constant value determined by the organizers)

### 3. Social Compliance Score ( \( S \) )
- A score reflecting the robot's adherence to social norms, such as maintaining appropriate distances from pedestrians and avoiding abrupt movements.  
- This score ranges between **0** (non-compliant) and **1** (fully compliant).

---

### üöÄ Overall Performance Score

The overall performance score is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Score} = \frac{1}{T + P} \times S
$$

Where:  
- \( T \) = Completion time (in seconds)  
- \( P \) = Total collision penalty  
- \( S \) = Social compliance score  

> **Note**: A **higher score** indicates better performance, balancing efficiency, safety, and social compliance.

| ...      | ...          | ...                     | ...                   | ...                        | ...             |

### üìä Score Calculation Formula
\[
\text{Final Score} = \frac{1}{T + P} \times S
\]
Where:  
- \( T \) = Completion Time (in seconds)  
- \( P \) = Collision Penalty  
- \( S \) = Social Compliance Score (between 0 and 1)  

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Interpret the Scores
- **Higher scores** indicate better navigation performance, accounting for efficiency, safety, and social awareness.  
- **Collision Penalties**: Every collision incurs a predefined penalty, increasing the total score denominator.  
- **Social Compliance**: Robots that adhere to social norms and safe navigation behaviors receive higher scores.
